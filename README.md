This is purely an **experiment** and **exploration** of [schema.org's Recipe](https://schema.org/Recipe). This is a *heavily* simplified exploration as they only support three fields. For example:
```json
{
  "name": "Lorem Ipsum",
  "ingredients": [ "Lorem", "Ipsum" ],
  "steps": [ "Step 1", "Step 2", "Step 3" ]
}
```
These were entirely generated by Microsoft Copilot and Claude and are *not* intended to be used in practice on a project.

## Demos
Below, you can access the prototypes. They are in order from "least polished" to "more polished," but they all ultimately do more or less the same thing.

1. [Microsoft Copilot Attempt #1](https://avo-ucsd.github.io/08-brainstorm-playground/recipe_json_test_Copilot_1.html)
2. [Microsoft Copilot Attempt #2](https://avo-ucsd.github.io/08-brainstorm-playground/recipe_json_test_Copilot_2.html)
3. [Claude Attempt](https://avo-ucsd.github.io/08-brainstorm-playground/recipe_json_test_Claude.html)

If you want to test loading a JSON file, there are samples available in [sample_jsons/](https://github.com/avo-ucsd/08-brainstorm-playground/tree/main/sample_json)
